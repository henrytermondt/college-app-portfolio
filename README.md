# College Application Porfolio

## Psilab
[Psilab](https://henrytermondt.github.io/Psilab/) is an educational tool to help teachers and students interactively visualize complex topics in quantum mechanics related to wave functions. It uses the technique I developed in the [paper I published](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e1lBGgglsc7L6bBsaPrYJ774FbyN7Hj1/view) to allow it to run on low powered computers, like school Chromebooks.

## Codec
[Codec](https://henrytermondt.github.io/codec/) is a repository of explanations of educational programming projects to help intermediate programmers improve.

## Capture
[Capture](https://staplecactus764.github.io/capture/) is a game I designed, created, and shared on the Khan Academy Computer Science Community ([link to Khan Academy page](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/capture-game/5223543242539008)). It is in the top 0.05% of most popular programs and, at the time I am writing this, is the 155 most popular program of all time.

## Acuity
Acuity AI Photo Detector ([demo video](https://youtu.be/aeKyIObTrvA)) is an AI generated image detection website which runs an a custom AI model in the browser. I trained it by fine tuning the ConvNeXt Tiny model.

## Galaxy Simulation
[This program](https://henrytermondt.github.io/barnes-hut/) uses the Barnes-Hut algorithm (taught in advanced CS undergraduate courses or at a graduate level) and GPU acceleration to simulate 150,000 stars interacting with each other in real time.
